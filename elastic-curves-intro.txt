Dear all,

Welcome to the SGI project on elastic curves and how to connect them with joints!
We will get started with the project proper on Monday, so I put together a list of topics that you can look into during the weekend if you feel like it.

Mathsy stuff:
 - Broadly speaking, this project will involve some calculus and optimization. If it has been a while since your last calculus class, brush up on concepts such as "partial derivatives", "gradients", "local minima", and "Lagrange multipliers".
 - The central mathematical objects in this project are plane curves from differential geometry. Remind yourself of concepts such as "parametrized curves", "tangents", "curvature", "arc-length parametrizations", "inflection points".
 - This has probably come up during SGI already: writing a system of linear equations (or inequalities) in matrix form.

Computer-sciencey stuff:
 - A popular representation for free-form curves on a computer are "B-Spline curves". These are used in software such as Illustrator and Blender to let the user define curves by manipulating control points. To get a feel for how they work, start up Blender, select Add > Curve > Nurbs Curve, and play with the control points and the order (degree) of the curve. The Matlab code that we will use has a B-Spline curve implementation already, so feel free to take a look at that as well.
 - We will use Matlab to solve "linear programs", i.e., optimization problems in which a linear objective function is min/maximized, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. Take a look at the documentation for Matlab's linear program solver and try out some of the examples: https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/linprog.html
 - Matlab has mechanisms for writing code that reacts to user interactions with figures. Find out how you can let the user define control points for a B-Spline curve by clicking on a figure. Can you let the user drag existing controls points around to manipulate the curve? Can you redraw the updated B-Spline curve in real time?

Codebase:
 - The code base we will use is pretty minimal: It only has an implementation of B-Spline curves, and a few functions that generate 2d geometry as vector graphics and export it to SVG.
 - You can check out the code from the repository 'elastic-curves' on the SGI-2021 GitHub. The 'main' script is test_spline_curve.m.

Super looking forward to our project! :)

Best regards,
Christian
